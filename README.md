# ColPali Qdrant Demo

This repository contains a demo notebook showcasing how to use **ColPali** with **Qdrant** for efficient document retrieval. The notebook demonstrates how to use **binary quantization** and **multivector indexing** to enhance search performance, using a Colab environment with a T4 GPU.

## üìö Notebook Overview

The primary notebook in this repository is [`colpali_demo_binary.ipynb`](./colpali_demo_binary.ipynb). It includes detailed steps and code examples to achieve the following:

- **Setup Qdrant**: Create and configure collections with multi-vector support.
- **ColPali Implementation**: Use ColPali‚Äôs approach to enhance document retrieval capabilities.
- **Binary Quantization**: Implement binary quantization for efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors.

## üöÄ Getting Started
