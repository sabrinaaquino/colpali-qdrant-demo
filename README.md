# ColPali Qdrant Demo

This repository features a hands-on notebook that dives into leveraging ColPali with Qdrant for efficient document retrieval. In it, you'll explore how techniques like binary quantization and multivector indexing can boost search performance, all within a Colab environment running on a T4 GPU.

## üìö Notebook Overview

The primary notebook in this repository is [`colpali_demo_binary.ipynb`](./colpali_demo_binary.ipynb). It includes detailed steps and code examples to achieve the following:

- **Setup Qdrant**: Create and configure collections with multi-vector support.
- **ColPali Implementation**: Use ColPali‚Äôs approach to enhance document retrieval capabilities.
- **Binary Quantization**: Implement binary quantization for efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Open in Google Colab**: You can open and run the notebook in Google Colab using the badge below:
